# SPL64
A system programming language compiler for the Twin-64 System. The idea is to have a higher level way to write low level code instead of pure assembler language. The compiler will produce an assembler file for the assembler to process.


## Scalar types

```
<typ>               ->  <scalar-typ> | <structured-typ>

<scalar-typ>        ->  "BYTE" | "SHORT" | "WORD" | "INT"

<array-typ>         ->  "ARRAY" <const-expr> "OF" <typ>
                        "END

<struct-typ>        ->  "STRUCT" [ "(" <ident> ")" ]
                        [ <field-list> ]
                        "END"    

<field-list>        ->  { <ident> ":" <typ> ";" }

<pointer-typ>       ->  "POINTER" "TO" <typ"> ";"

<string-typ>        ->  "STRING" "[“ <const-expr> "]" { ":=" <str-val> } ";"
```

                        ( should we have ENTER and LEAVE ? )

## Statements

```

                        <loop-stmt> |
                        <with-stmt> |

                        { "ELSEIF" <expr> "THEN" <stmt-seq> }
                        [ "ELSE" <stmt-seq> ]

                        <loop-stmt-seq> 
                        "END

<loop-stmt-seq>     ->  <stmt-seq> | "CONTINUE" ";" | "BREAK" ";"

<with-stmt>         ->  "WITH" <adr> "DO" 
                        <stmt-seq> 
                        "END"

<repeat-stmt>       ->  "REPEAT" 
                        <stmt-seq>
                        "UNTIL" <expr> "END"

<case-stmt>         ->  "CASE" <expr> "OF" 
                        <case-list>
                        { "ELSE" <stmt-seq> }
                        END

<case-list>         ->  { "WHEN" <const-val> ":" <stmt-seq> ";" }



```

## Example

```
MODULE example 

    IMPORT aModule;
    EXPORTS ;

    CONST maxItem = 10;

    TYPE listEntry = STRUCT

        field1 : WORD;
        field2 : BYTE;
        field3 : POINTER TO int;
    END

    TYPE payLoadEntry = STRUCT ( listEntry )

        field4 : INT;
    END

    FUNC add2 ( in1 : WORD; in2: WORD ) : WORD;

        add2 = in1 + in2;
    END
END

```

Alternative: simplify if we mimic an IR type language. We could have predefined types
such as words, bytes, etc. We could explicitly have statements like ENTER or LEAVE in 
a function, and so on.

Many assembler instructions could be be just predefined functions: e.g.
    R1 :-= EXTR( R2, pos, len );
instead of 
    R1 := R2.[pos:len];
